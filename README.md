### Abstract
The project consists in the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network built from scratch using Python, without using pre-built libraries. 
The overall validation schema consists in a preliminary screening phase to reduce the hyperparameters search space, followed by a first coarse grid-search and a second but finer one. All the explored models are validated with a 4-fold cross validation.
The resulting model is a 1 hidden layer network with 25 units each and TanH activation.
